Saffola follows close behind. It's more than a 2,000 crore brand. So these are substantive brands which have held their own. And within themselves, they've split into many tributaries, so to speak.

I think one of the biggest changes that has happened in Marico is, and if I look at Marico 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 was, initially, we started off as an Indian company with most of the large presence in India with Parachute, Saffola. We started venturing into other brands and other markets. Initially, we started catering to the Indian diaspora, then started acquiring businesses. So today, our international business is around 26%-27% of our turnover. It's actually, we compete in much more different categories, like we are there in shampoo, baby. We are there in ethnic hair in South Africa. It's a very, very successful and profitable, in spite of all the vagaries of currency and other things.

The other interesting thing that has worked far more in developed markets working in India is what I call category premiumization, which is through format. For example, if you look at the entire home cleaning or detergents, it started with a cake, went to powder, went to liquid, went to pods today. And each premiumisation gave consumer better benefit, better experience, and your ability to therefore premiumize and charge. So that's how the categories have spread. And I think in each category, for example, today, serum, for example, it's a bridge product for hair oiling because it's a contemporary format.\n\n "

And there's a great trend. And if you look at some of the successes of even Ayurvedic brands today, I think what has happened is that e-commerce has democratised availability and decreased exit barrier, entry barriers. In today's US, there are a lot of Indian brands today who have been successful in the Ayurveda thing. Now, I mean, Indian brands have transcended beyond Patel stores in the USA.

We are also seeing Western adoption of the category. By the way, the category is equally strong in the Middle East, North Africa. We're seeing some resurgence of it as a category in some of the Western markets. So I think it's a habit. Just as I said that in both hair, skin and other things that traditional habits are coming back. And I think the biggest thing is natural. And the natural can be given anything. If you look at, say, if you look at K-Beauty, one of the magic ingredients is Jeju volcanic ash, for example. Or if you look at some products from an Amazonian rainforest.

So it's like, you know, fusion Indian food, you know, in a Michelin star restaurant. So I think that is one trend which is happening, that how do you deliver Indianness in a contemporary format, for example. So if I look at serum as a category, serum is nothing but oil plus, you know, something which is a far more, better sensorially. And if you look at some of the brands, you know, global brands who have gone into serum as a category, it's actually nothing but a leave-in conditioning, which is also nourishing.

Even in rural, if people are challenged with an outlay, they will still want an aspirational product. And that's why you have, say a brand like a Dove or a L'Oreal in a sachet. Because people and what has also happened is today, the media you consume, the information you consume is universal. It is not that in earlier days, you had a Doordarshan and you had satellite television and something. It's a common one.

The core engine, which I call the mothership, runs on scale efficiency. It's a repeatable model of mass distribution, mass marketing, and it operates with a different cycle time. Perhaps the risk appetite is low because the degree of risk when you try to do any change is different. The Engine 2 works with high-velocity innovation. So the approach Engine 2, is think big, start small, scale up fast. You need to quickly destroy things, stop doing things. The velocity of innovation is different. The risk-taking appetite is different, but they are very, very, there would be a hundred bite-sized risks, you know. And secondly, therefore, the process system, the kind of people, the kind of compensation, everything is different. And we were comfortable working with two different systems. A lot of legacy companies want to say that this is the thing which has worked in the last 200 years, I'm going to impose that on the second one.\n\n "

We also realise that different sets of mindset of people work in. So if I look at typical leadership in these businesses, an interesting thing is that it has also offered avenues for a lot of, like we have four companies, therefore potentially four new business ads. Beardo, I took a punt, by the way, Beardo first CEO, when we took over Beardo in 2020, was a management trainee of ours. He has worked in legacy brands for 14 years, but I think attitudinally he was an entrepreneur. And he did it. But what we are looking at now is a set of people who have perhaps started their lives in CPG, but experienced new age, the companies and then wanting to go to a digital company. Because if you have been just working in a traditional set for say 15-20 years or 10 years, it's very difficult to adopt, you know.

And within engine one also, I think we have been a little more different in food because sometimes new food business also requires different capabilities because now we are getting into snacking, experimenting with some other things. So therefore, they also require different capabilities. So I think… so I see three engines because the international business and other engine, we have a fairly profitable and a successful international business. So almost three engines running.

We have this concept called founder's mentality, which says that if you are empowered, you have ownership, you think like a founder.

So one of the things which we are doing is investing in distribution. In the top 10 towns, organised retail is going to grow and, therefore, there will be a challenge on the general trade model in that. And we believe that in India it will be an 'and' but not an 'or' angle. Given the vastness of our country and given the logistics of it, everything will coexist.
